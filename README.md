# NumPyNet(XORproblem): Neural Network from First Principles

A lightweight implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) built entirely in NumPy. 
No PyTorch, No TensorFlow. Just Linear Algebra.


This project demonstrates:
- **Matrix Calculus:** Manual implementation of the Chain Rule (Backpropagation).
- **Optimization:** Gradient Descent without Autograd engines.
- **Architecture:** Understanding dimensions and broadcasting in deep learning.
